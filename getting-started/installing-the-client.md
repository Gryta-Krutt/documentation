# ‚≠ê Installing the client

## Installation

In order to install the Gryt Client on your system, visit [this page](https://github.com/Gryta-Krutt/client/releases) on GitHub and download the latest release of the client. Pick the system you are using and begin the installation.

This will install the _pre-configured_ Gryt Client that is by default connected to our _preview-server_. This client will **automatically** **update** according to when new releases are published to our GitHub repository.

It will limit your capabilities, such as limit the maximum allowed upload file-size, how many servers you can own, how many simultaneous connections are allowed on your owned server, etc.</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">**These limitations are explicit to the**</mark>** **<mark style="color:red;">**preview server**</mark><mark style="color:purple;">**, once you host your own server you are free to control these limits as you wish.**</mark>
